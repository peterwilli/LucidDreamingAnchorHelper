# Lucid Dreaming Anchor Helper

An anchor is an object that you use as a trigger to induce a lucid dream. These are everyday objects like water in my case. When sitting at the computer for a long time (i.e during long work hours) you probably won't encounter these objects as much.

This application will randomly display images (i.e your anchors) on different locations of your screen, allowing you continue your practice while working! For the full technique, see https://redd.it/dw7geg

## How to use

Setting up is really simple:

- Execute the app
- The app will make an images folder in the same folder as the app is in
- Download images of your anchors (i.e from Google images) and save them in that folder
- Set your interval to see the images, and when you see one, do the techniques as mentioned in https://redd.it/dw7geg
